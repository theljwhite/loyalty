This is still an unnamed project and work in progress. Create an on-chain loyalty program with points, objectives, and tiers. Optionally, also reward loyalty program users with ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 rewards.

This allows creators to deploy their own custom loyalty program smart contract and optional escrow smart contract in which creators can reward users with ERC20 tokens, ERC721 tokens, or ERC1155 tokens which are held in escrow as users complete objectives and tiers.

This project serves as a frontend for my smart contracts here:
https://github.com/theljwhite/loyaltysmartcontractst1/

They are in a separate repo for now as I have yet to combine them into a single repo because frankly I don't need to yet (this is still primarily a prototype).

I usually dont make these repos public, but for now it will remain public.

This app was scaffolded using create T3 app. Read more about it here:

# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.
